                        <p>
                            We, Visionary Animal Shelter located in Malad West, Mumbai, Maharashtra believe that our moral duty as humane individuals, is to help & assist the animals to the best of our ability. We have no major philosophies, but we believe that animals have a right to food, shelter, comfort, love and life like we do. We were perhaps born to alleviate the suffering of these neglected, abused, four legged, slithering and feathered friends, who came to this planet before us, our soul mates from the animal kingdom. We aim to to provide medical care, home and rehabilitation to injured pets with known or unknown owners. We reach out to animals and birds, starving on the streets and provide them food, care and a loving home.Along with the rescuing, we also run sterilisation programs and treatment camps. We strive to avail a loving home to the these beautiful creatures and also conduct adoption fares. We are actively involved in all kind of animal welfare programs and missions. Contact us today!
